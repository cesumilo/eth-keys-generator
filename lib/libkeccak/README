NAME
	libkeccak - Keccak-family hashing library

DESCRIPTION
	libkeccak is a bit-oriented lanewise implementation of
	the Keccak-family with support for extend output size,
	state marshalling, algorithm tuning with implicit parameters,
	secure erasure of sensitive data, and HMAC.

RATIONALE
	Keccak won the SHA-3 competition. We need a library for it,
	and let it be bit-oriented.

SEE ALSO
	sha3sum, libsha2(7)
